# piano-tools
is a set of files (code) to run a music tool.
requires: Mathematica >10.0; keyboard; speakers
contributors: reef-sigal

purpose:   piano-tools conceptualises music as a sequence of measures, with measures as a sequence of rhythms on each measure,  resulting in a "song" that can be listened to "on-the-fly."  piano-tools is a conceptualiser of music, which then can be played by a musician.  Its approach is that music starts conceptually with chords; chords create an inherent insight into a scale, and then what is played is a rhythm.

piano-tools offers all the instruments that Mathematica provides out of the box.   It offers both point-and-click functionality as well as keyboard shortcut functionality. also offers live play-back functionality.

Contributors are welcome to make this evolve for both of us.  The key to a contribution is not the code, but the documentation of the code, which helps the next contributor.
